```

**Agent description**:
```
Main orchestrator that coordinates invoice processing workflow by delegating to specialized agents
```

**Agent instruction**:
```
You are the Orchestrator Agent for Invoisaic, an AI-powered invoice processing system.

Your role is to:

2. Coordinate with specialized agents (Extraction, Compliance, Validation)
3. Manage the workflow and ensure all steps complete successfully
4. Return the final processed invoice data

Workflow:
1. First, call the Extraction Agent to extract data from the invoice
2. Then, call the Compliance Agent to validate against tax regulations
3. Finally, call the Validation Agent to perform final checks and formatting
4. Return the complete results

Always maintain context between agent calls and handle errors gracefully.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Part 4: Create Agent Aliases

For each agent, we need to create an alias for deployment:

### Step 4.1: Create Alias for Each Agent

**For EACH of the 4 agents**:

1. **Go to the agent details page**
2. **Click "Create alias"** (top right)
3. **Alias name**: `prod`
4. **Description**: `Production alias`

- Extraction Alias ID = `__________`
- Compliance Alias ID = `__________`
- Validation Alias ID = `__________`

---

## ðŸ“‹ Part 5: Update Environment Variables

### Step 5.1: Update .env.agents

Open `backend/.env.agents` and update:

```env
# Orchestrator Agent
ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT_ID=<your-orchestrator-agent-id>
ORCHESTRATOR_ALIAS_ID=<your-orchestrator-alias-id>

# Extraction Agent
EXTRACTION_AGENT_ID=<your-extraction-agent-id>
EXTRACTION_ALIAS_ID=<your-extraction-alias-id>

# Compliance Agent  
COMPLIANCE_AGENT_ID=<your-compliance-agent-id>
COMPLIANCE_ALIAS_ID=<your-compliance-alias-id>

# Validation Agent
VALIDATION_AGENT_ID=<your-validation-agent-id>
VALIDATION_ALIAS_ID=<your-validation-alias-id>

# Knowledge Base (Already done)
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID=2DW2JBM2MN

# OpenSearch Collection (Already done)
OPENSEARCH_COLLECTION_NAME=bedrock-knowledge-base-vmt2uv
OPENSEARCH_COLLECTION_ENDPOINT=69wn63f5ls25u4l4wtr7.ap-south-1.aoss.amazonaws.com
OPENSEARCH_COLLECTION_ARN=arn:aws:aoss:ap-south-1:202533497839:collection/69wn63f5ls25u4l4wtr7
```

## ðŸ“‹ Part 6: Test the Agents

### Step 6.1: Test Compliance Agent with Knowledge Base

1. **Go to Compliance Agent details page**
2. **Click "Test" button** (top right)
3. **In the test console, enter**:
   ```
   What are the GST requirements for invoices in India?
   ```
4. **Verify**: Should return information from the knowledge base about GST rates, e-invoicing, etc.

---

### Step 6.2: Test Extraction Agent

1. **Go to Extraction Agent details page**
2. **Click "Test"**
3. **Enter**:
   ```
   Extract data from this invoice:
   
   Invoice #: INV-2024-001
   Date: 2024-10-21
   Seller: ABC Corp, 123 Main St, New York, NY
   Buyer: XYZ Ltd, 456 Oak Ave, Mumbai, India
   
   Items:
   - Widget A: 10 units @ $50 = $500
   - Widget B: 5 units @ $100 = $500
   
   Subtotal: $1000
   Tax (18% GST): $180
   Total: $1180
   ```
4. **Verify**: Should extract structured JSON data

---

## ðŸ“‹ Part 7: Configure Agent Collaboration (Advanced)

To enable agents to call each other, we need to set up action groups. This is optional for initial testing but required for production.

### Step 7.1: Create Lambda Functions for Agent Actions

**This requires**:
1. Lambda functions that invoke other agents
2. IAM permissions for cross-agent invocation
3. Action group schemas

**Skip this for now** - we can test agents individually first, then add collaboration later.
